    """Translates a SMILES into a SELFIES.
    The SMILES to SELFIES translation occurs independently of the SELFIES
    alphabet and grammar. Thus, :func:`selfies.encoder` will work regardless of
    the alphabet and grammar rules that :py:mod:`selfies` is operating on,
    assuming the input is a valid SMILES. Additionally, :func:`selfies.encoder`
    preserves the atom and branch order of the input SMILES; thus, one
    could generate random SELFIES corresponding to the same molecule by
    generating random SMILES, and then translating them.
    However, encoding and then decoding a SMILES may not necessarily yield
    the original SMILES. Reasons include:
        1.  SMILES with aromatic symbols are automatically
            Kekulized before being translated.
        2.  SMILES that violate the bond constraints specified by
            :mod:`selfies` will be successfully encoded by
            :func:`selfies.encoder`, but then decoded into a new molecule
            that satisfies the constraints.
        3.  The exact ring numbering order is lost in :func:`selfies.encoder`,
            and cannot be reconstructed by :func:`selfies.decoder`.
    Finally, note that :func:`selfies.encoder` does **not** check if the input
    SMILES is valid, and should not be expected to reject invalid inputs.
    It is recommended to use RDKit to first verify that the SMILES are
